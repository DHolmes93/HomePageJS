# 🌐 Personal Website - CS50x Project  

**A personal website created as part of the Harvard CS50x course.**  
This website showcases my journey in programming, highlights key projects, and shares insights about my time in the CS50x class.

- **Projects:** Showcases projects completed during CS50x and beyond.  
- **Contact Me:** A form to connect with me or share feedback.
